    "# PYTHON NOTES\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constants \n",
    "Constants are fixed values that cannot be changed; like strings, letters, and numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numeric constants have no syntax: print(12345)\n",
    "- Strings constants have a quotation mark: print(\"Hello, world\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables \n",
    "Variables are used to assign names for stored data and can be retrieved at a later time.\n",
    "You can also change the contents of variable at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start w/ letters and consist of letters, numbers, or underscores\n",
    "- Best practice are Mnemonic naming conventions (leads to better references and memory aid)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reserved Words\n",
    "Reserved words are Python keywords that cannot be used as variable names or indentifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operator \n",
    "Operator is a symbol or a set of symbols that perform a specific operation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions\n",
    "Expressions involve variable assignment, list creation, and function calls\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Operation   |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| +  | Addition          |\n",
    "| -  | Subtraction       |\n",
    "| *  | Multiplication    |\n",
    "| /  | Division          |\n",
    "| ** | Power             |\n",
    "| %  | Remainder         |\n",
    "\n",
    " Operator Precedence Rules (top to bottom & left to right within)\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Parenthesis\n",
    "2. Power\n",
    "3. Multiplication & Division \n",
    "4. Addition & Subtraction\n",
    "5. Left to Right\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type\n",
    "Type tells Python the differnce between data\n",
    "\n",
    "- In an interger + means addition \n",
    "- In an string + means concatenate\n",
    "- In Python 3 divisions will always produce a float type \n",
    "\n",
    "## String Conversion\n",
    "String conversion converts an object of any data tyoe into a string\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use int() & float() to convert between strings and intergers\n",
    "- String conversion without an numeric character will throw error\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Input \n",
    "User input instructs python to read data from the user using the input() funciton\n",
    "\n",
    "- No matter what value the user provides the function will return a string\n",
    "- If we want to read a number, you would have to user type() function wrapped around the input() function\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Execution\n",
    "Conditional execution is the ability to execute parts of code when conditions are met, allowing the program to brand and evaluate certain conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "- if statements only execute when something is true\n",
    "- else statements only execute when something is false\n",
    "- elif statements test multiple condition similar to the AND/OR operator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "| Python Comparison Operator | Meaning |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `==` | Equal to |\n",
    "| `!=` | Not equal to |\n",
    "| `<` | Less than |\n",
    "| `>` | Greater than |\n",
    "| `<=` | Less than or equal to |\n",
    "| `>=` | Greater than or equal to |\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators are two values that produces a Boolean value as a result\n",
    "\n",
    "- Booleen expressions ask whether something is true or false, which is used to control the programs flow\n",
    "- Comparison operators look at the variables, but doesn't change the variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentaion is a core feature to Python. It's used to tell Python how to execute a block of code. Indentation is used in loops, conditional statements, functions, and classes. Most indentaion occurs after -> example: and reduce indent to level of example: to end the block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nested decisions are multiple executions that occur in a block of code\n",
    "- One-way decisions are a single execution that occur in a block of code\n",
    "- Two-way decisions are a fork of an execution that only choose one path in a block of code\n",
    "- Multi-way checks the order for which the execution takes place wihtin blow of code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Try & Exept \n",
    "\n",
    "Try and Except are used to handle exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution of a program. The try block contains the code that may cause an exception, while the except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  ExceptionType is the type of exception that the except block should handle.\n",
    "-  finally: statement executes code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not\n",
    "-  else: statement tests if no exception was raised\n",
    "- When ever a block fails the execption is raised and no line execture other than the failed block\n",
    "- It's best practice to try & execpt in with single blocks rather than multiple\n",
