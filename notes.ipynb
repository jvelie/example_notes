    "\n",
    "## Basic Python Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sequential: This is the simplest pattern, where the code runs from top to bottom, executing each statement in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Conditional: This pattern allows you to execute different code depending on whether a certain condition is true or false. This is done with the 'if', 'elif', and 'else' statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Looping: This pattern allows you to execute a block of code multiple times. There are two main types of loops in Python: 'for' loops and 'while' loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Functions: This pattern allows you to define reusable blocks of code that can be called multiple times with different input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Recursion: This pattern involves a function calling itself in order to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Object-oriented programming: This pattern allows you to create classes and objects that encapsulate data and behavior, providing a way to organize code and create reusable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Exception handling: This pattern allows you to handle errors and unexpected situations in your code, providing a way to gracefully handle failures and prevent crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constants \n",
    "Constants are fixed values that cannot be changed; like strings, letters, and numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numeric constants have no syntax: print(12345)\n",
    "- Strings constants have a quotation mark: print(\"Hello, world\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables \n",
    "Variables are used to assign names for stored data and can be retrieved at a later time.\n",
    "You can also change the contents of variable at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start w/ letters and consist of letters, numbers, or underscores\n",
    "- Best practice are Mnemonic naming conventions (leads to better references and memory aid)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reserved Words\n",
    "Reserved words are Python keywords that cannot be used as variable names or indentifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operator \n",
    "Operator is a symbol or a set of symbols that perform a specific operation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 'is' and 'is not' operator is similar to == with difference that 'is' checks the value and type of what is being compared. Example (0 == 0.0 True) (0 is 0.0 False) best only used on Booleen and None types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions\n",
    "Expressions involve variable assignment, list creation, and function calls\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Operation   |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| +  | Addition          |\n",
    "| -  | Subtraction       |\n",
    "| *  | Multiplication    |\n",
    "| /  | Division          |\n",
    "| ** | Power             |\n",
    "| %  | Remainder         |\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator Precedence Rules (top to bottom & left to right within)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parenthesis\n",
    "2. Power\n",
    "3. Multiplication & Division \n",
    "4. Addition & Subtraction\n",
    "5. Left to Right\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type\n",
    "A data type tells Python the differnce between data\n",
    "\n",
    "- In an interger + means addition \n",
    "- In an string + means concatenate\n",
    "- In Python 3 divisions will always produce a float type \n",
    "\n",
    "## String Conversion\n",
    "A string conversion converts an object of any data tyoe into a string\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use int() & float() to convert between strings and intergers\n",
    "- String conversion without an numeric character will throw error\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Input \n",
    "User input instructs python to read data from the user using the input() funciton\n",
    "\n",
    "- No matter what value the user provides the function will return a string\n",
    "- If we want to read a number, you would have to user type() function wrapped around the input() function\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Execution\n",
    "A conditional execution is the ability to execute parts of code when conditions are met, allowing the program to brand and evaluate certain conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "- if statements only execute when something is true\n",
    "- else statements only execute when something is false\n",
    "- elif statements test multiple condition similar to the AND/OR operator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "| Python Comparison Operator | Meaning |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `==` | Equal to |\n",
    "| `!=` | Not equal to |\n",
    "| `<` | Less than |\n",
    "| `>` | Greater than |\n",
    "| `<=` | Less than or equal to |\n",
    "| `>=` | Greater than or equal to |\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators are two values that produces a Boolean value as a result\n",
    "\n",
    "- Booleen expressions ask whether something is true or false, which is used to control the programs flow\n",
    "- Comparison operators look at the variables, but doesn't change the variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indentation\n",
    "An indentaion is a core feature to Python. It's used to tell Python how to execute a block of code. Indentation is used in loops, conditional statements, functions, and classes. Most indentaion occurs after -> example: and reduce indent to level of example: to end the block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nested decisions are multiple executions that occur in a block of code\n",
    "- One-way decisions are a single execution that occur in a block of code\n",
    "- Two-way decisions are a fork of an execution that only choose one path in a block of code\n",
    "- Multi-way checks the order for which the execution takes place wihtin blow of code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Try & Exept \n",
    "Try and Except are used to handle exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution of a program. The try block contains the code that may cause an exception, while the except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'ExceptionType' is the type of exception that the except block should handle.\n",
    "- 'finally': statement executes code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not\n",
    "- 'else': statement tests if no exception was raised\n",
    "- When ever a block fails the execption is raised and no line execture other than the failed block\n",
    "- It's best practice to try & execpt in with single blocks rather than multiple\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It takes input (arguments) and returns output (return value) after performing its defined task. Functions are designed to make code modular, organized and easy to read, as well as reduce the amount of code duplication. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use 'def' to build a custom function followed by optional parameterers in parentheses\n",
    "- The body of the function is indented. Indented lines are defining the function but are not executing the function\n",
    "- The def is used to store while calling the function will invoke aka call for reus. This is the store and reuse pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arguments\n",
    "An argument is value that is passed into a function or some other stored object. Additionally arguments pass values to objects and can even pass another function inside of a function 'pretty, meta!'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can pass in an argument into a function as its input whe the function is called\n",
    "- Arguments can direct the functions work when we call the function at different times\n",
    "- Always put the funtion in parentheses after we name the function\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "A parameter is a variable which is used in the function definition. It is a \\handle\\ that allows the code in the function to access the arguments for a particular function invocation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Return Values\n",
    "Often a function will take its arguments, do some computation, and return a value to be used as the value of the function call in the calling expression. The return keyword is used for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A useful function is one that produces a result (or returns value)\n",
    "- The return statement ends the function execution and sends back the result of the function\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loops and Iteration\n",
    "Loops are repeated steps that have iterate vaiables that change each time through a loop. Often these iterations variables go through a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While loops function simaliry to a if statement. Think as a step the re asks the same question a set number of times then finishes when the execution is false.\n",
    "- Break statments ends the current loop and jumps to the statement immediatly following the loop. This allow someone to test the loop anywhere in the body of the loop.\n",
    "- Continue statement ends the current iteration and jumps to the top of the loop and starts the next iteration.\n",
    "- Definite loops often contain a list of items in a set. The for construct will run the loop once for each item in a set. These type of loops are called definite loops because they execute an exact number of times. \\definite loops iterate through the members of a set.\\\n",
    "- Loop idionms are patterns on how we construct loops. The trick is \"knowing\" something about the whole loop when you are stuck writing code that only sees one entry at a time.\n",
    "- Counting in a loop requires a counter variable that starts at 0 and add one each time we run through the loop.\n",
